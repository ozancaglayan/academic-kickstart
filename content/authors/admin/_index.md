I am a PhD student at Informatics Laboratory (LIUM) of Le Mans University where I am mostly working on Neural Machine Translation
with a focus on Multimodality. During summer 2018, I visited *Johns Hopkins University* as a graduate student in the
[Grounded Sequence to Sequence Transduction Team](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/grounded-sequence-sequence-transduction), within the [JSALT](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/about) workshop.

Between 2012-2017, I worked as a research & teaching assistant in the Computer Engineering Dept. of Galatasaray University in Istanbul, Turkey
where I lectured practical sessions for undergraduate courses such as *Algorithms, C Programming, Microprocessors and Operating Systems.*
I obtained my MSc. degree from Galatasaray University as well where I developed a simple embedded system for a Brain-computer Interface
application. You can access my MSc. thesis from [here](/files/msc.pdf).

Between 2007-2012, I took part in the [Pardus Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardus_(operating_system)) project within the
*Scientific & Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)* as a full-time Linux developer.

I am a signatory of the petition called *Academics for Peace* against which a series of unlawful actions have been
taken by the Turkish state since 2016. Click [here](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/judicial-harassment-academics-peace)
